The optional-silence phone <SIL> occupies 22.9% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 79.1% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence <SIL> occupies 2.5% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if <SIL> frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences <SIL> comprise 1.6% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (3,11.0,3)
